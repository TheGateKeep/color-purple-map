            Celie starts being at Pa's home, then later lives in the home of Mr after marriage.
            During both, she seems to suffer in some way, but as she grows she seems to understand her suffering more.
            
            Shug appears in person here first, and spends a good portion of the story here, mainly staying later on due to Celie.
            She chooses her travels based on what she cares for, but before often travel based on her own desires.
            She is one of the more determined characters in the book, starting off as one who does not let herself be controlled, and faces little opposition in that regard.
            
            Nettie starts the story running from Pa and Mr, leaving Celie behind. This contrast her later lengths she goes to help the Olinka.
            Her travels are done for helping people, firstly herself and then for the Olinka and then for Celie.
            
            Sofia, despite being one of the most resisting characters when it comes to control over her, first with Harpo and then with the mayor, almost always stays within here.
            She fights tooth and nail to stop Harpo controlling her, and briefly leaves to some unknown place, before returning to be arrested and essentially enslaved.
            While Shug simply does and is not stopped, Sofia fights against those who try to stop her, and she has suffered for it.
            
            Mary does stuff with Harpo.
